# URI Online Judge

My solutions to the URI platform programming problems.
Mostly written in Go.


## Setup

The platform uses go1.8.1 so download it:

    make golang

And initialize your environment variables to use it:

    source golang-init.sh


After that, just cd into a problem's directory and run the tests:

    cd beginner/1001.extremely_basic
    go test
